# telecom-operator-which-plan-brings-more-revenue-for-advertising-campaign
In this project, we are going to analyze the data of a telecom operator. The company offers its users two prepaid plans, which we are going to research and determine which one of them brings more revenue to the company. In the end, the findings will help the commercial department to adjust its budget for advertising campaigns on the most profitable plan.
